# Sprint 4 Presentation Requirements

**Presentation**

In class on you have approximately 20-25 minutes to describe your project.

Your first aim is to impress the customer by describing and demonstrating the features you have built that will be useful to the business. In general these are:

1. Ability to generate a rich set of data based on the various criteria that were provided, with the data being delivered in both .csv files and a database
2. Range of queries that you support
3. Other cool stuff that you have done to impress the product owner.

Your second aim is to impress customer's dev team with the quality of your product. To this end, you should describe:

1. Your design
2. How to install/deploy the system
3. Code metrics
4. Test metrics

You are not expected to have everything perfect (you have until the next class to complete the project), so be open where there is still work to be done in terms of an incomplete feature or need for refactoring. Your product owners will validate that you deliver on your promises in the final week.

Submit your slides as a pdf on Canvas.

**Deliverable**

Meet with your Product Owner/Customer and:

1. Demonstrate any features that you promised to deliver in your final presentation
2. Show updated code/test metrics
3. Show final product documentation, which must cover:
    - where the code is
    - how to build the code
    - how to setup/install the product
    - known problems
    - any other relevant documents

[Submit a link to your Github, where the documentation lives.]
