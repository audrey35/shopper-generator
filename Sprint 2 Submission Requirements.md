# Sprint 2 Submission Requirements

This assessment will evaluate 3 aspects of Sprint 2:

1. how you delivered against your first sprint user stories
    1. Submit a .pdf file here that summarizes the stories you promised and what you delivered.
    2. Include URL to Trello and Github repo in this URL
2. the functionality you actually deliver for sprint 2
    1. Deliver useful functionality that can be demonstrated to and used by the customer.
    2. Includes tests that can be run to demonstrate the produce meets requirements.
3. an assessment of the quality of your code.
    1. CodeMR report (or something similar).
    2. Make an argument for the quality of your code (explain why you are satisfied with it's quality, or what else should be done).

To put this in perspective:

I expect Sprint 1 to be fairly easy to get full credit. Sprint 2 will have slightly higher expectations. Sprints 3 and 4 get progressively more challenging to get full marks :)

**Criteria**

- Delivery of stories
    - Did you deliver the stories you said you would for the sprint?
- Functionality of Deliverable
    - Does the system do what it's supposed to do? Do you have tests to prove it? Demonstrate the functionality to the customer.
- Code Quality
    - Make an argument for the quality of your code. This might include something like a CodeMR report and/or test coverage results. Be sure to be able to explain the interpretation to your customer.
- Summary Document
    - PDF report summarizing your sprint progress
- Demo to Customer
    - Schedule time with your customer to review your code and demonstrate functionality
