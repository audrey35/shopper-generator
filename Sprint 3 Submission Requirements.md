# Sprint 3 Submission Requirements

This assessment will evaluate 3 aspects of Sprint 3:

1. How you delivered against your sprint user stories
    1. Submit a .pdf file here that summarizes the stories you promised and what you delivered.
    2. Include URL to Trello and Github repo in this URL
2. The functionality you actually deliver for Sprint 3
    1. Deliver useful functionality that can be demonstrated to and used by the customer.
    2. Includes tests that can be run to demonstrate the produce meets requirements.
3. An assessment of the quality of your code.
    1. CodeMR report (or something similar).
    2. Make an argument for the quality of your code (explain why you are satisfied with it's quality, or what else should be done).

To put this in perspective:

I expect Sprint 1 to be fairly easy to get full credit. Sprint 2 will have slightly higher expectations. Sprints 3 and 4 get progressively more challenging to get full marks :)
