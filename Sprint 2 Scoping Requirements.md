# Sprint 2 Scoping Requirements

Our Met Market Manager has been SUPER busy!

But the good news is that he's excited about how things are going. Though he's been so busy, by the end of June he'll have some time to really dig into the generated data and assess how useful it will be. He's got quite a bit of experience using SQL, so if the data can be stored in a SQL database, he could easily run some queries and do his assessment. He wants to be able to ask some questions of the data like:

- On a sunny Sunday, what are the top 3 hours of day with the most shoppers? How does this compare to a sunny Saturday? Or Monday? Which hours have the fewest shoppers?
- If the weather is bad on a Saturday, how do the number of shoppers compare to a Tuesday, in terms of which hours are the busiest?
- If we change the senior shopping hours to Wednesday 1-3pm, how many customers will we have on Tuesday? Wednesday?
- If the dinner rush starts to shift (you know, things are weird with COVID), and is 4-5pm on weeknights, how shoppers will we have?

These are just some sample queries he rattled off to me as he was rushing around the shop the other day.

**Edited to add:**

**BUT: I know what he's really thinking about doing is generating two data sets (possibly with slightly different parameters), write a query, get some data back, and do something with that. So, you don't have to worry too much about those exact queries noted above, but you SHOULD be able to generate multiple sets of data and store them in the database. To do this, you'll need to be sure to save some metadata along with the data set. The metadata should include information about when that dataset was generated and what parameters were used to generate that dataset.**

He also said that while he's pretty comfortable with SQL (old school!), he's heard a lot about NoSQL. He'd love for you to determine if SQL or NoSQL is a better choice for this data, and why. He trusts your judgement, so you don't need his approval, but please be ready to explain why one is preferred to the other.Â  He's curious, a fast learner, and has a buddy he can ask for help if NoSQL turns out to be a better choice.

His last words were "Once we have this data in a database, there are all sorts of possibilities!!".
