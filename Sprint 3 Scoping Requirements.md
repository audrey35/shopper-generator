# Sprint 3 Scoping Requirements

Our buddy at the market has gone MIA (missing in action-- we haven't heard from him). You've sent him multiple emails but got no responses. So, you send a text message offering a demo next week. Finally, you get a response:

***"Sorry, it's been INSANE since things have started opening up! One idea, my data scientists will be very interested in this. Can you make the queries available over the Web? We can use curl or postman-- no front end needed. Just give us URL format instructions".***

***"Back at work after 4th July. Will be anxious to see progress"***

The joy of busy product owners, you think!! And then you point your browser at  [https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and start thinking about hosting your query code in a web server.

Submit a link to your Trello board and Github repo.
