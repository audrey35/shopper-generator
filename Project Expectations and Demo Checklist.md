# Project Expectations

A majority of this course is your team project.

- You are expected to deliver the project as a team.
- Dividing work among team members should be ***fair***; fair doesn't always mean ***equal***.
- No team member left behind:
    - Some of you might be more adept at programming or parts of the process than others. Don't leave your teammates behind!

Some tips:

- Automation: Automate whatever you can
    - Let your IDE do your agreed-upon code formatting.
    - Continuous build can run tests automatically
    - Use a deployment tool
- Let every member shine
    - Every individual on the team can shine in their own way
    - Give every team member enough structure to support them
- Your project is not done until all the tests pass
